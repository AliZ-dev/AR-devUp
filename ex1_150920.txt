It is possible to test a simple rospy command publisher, and a "safety" module:

Assume all of the following commands are done in the catkin workspace root dir.

1- catkin_make

2- source devel/setup.bash

3- roslaunch elfin_gazebo elfin3_empty_world.launch controller:=gravity_comp_controller

4- in new terminal (this doesn't need catkin workspace):
	roscore

5- in new terminal (this launches a simple tkinter control program):
	./src/ar-devup/src/arm_controllers/scripts/publish_test.py

6- in new terminal (this launches a script which observes the arm state, and reacts to certain situation):
	./src/ar-devup/src/arm_controllers/scripts/safety_test.py
